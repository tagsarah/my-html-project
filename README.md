# 🌿 PlanetShop – Indoor & Outdoor Plant Shop Website

## 🌱 About the Project

**PlanetShop** is my very first web development project. It’s a beginner-friendly website that showcases and promotes indoor and outdoor plants. This project represents a unique combination of my studies in **agronomy** and my growing interest in **software development**.  

The goal is to offer a simple, elegant platform that helps people discover, learn about, and eventually purchase the right plants for their homes or gardens.

## 👩‍💻 What I Learned

This was my **first project ever**, and I’m proud of how much I’ve learned:

- 🧱 **HTML** – to build the structure of the website  
- 🎨 **CSS** – to design and style the layout  
- 🧠 **JavaScript** – for adding interactivity  
- 🌐 **Git & GitHub** – for version control and publishing the project  
- ✨ **Design principles** – including color theory, layout, and usability  

I also learned how to debug problems, create a responsive layout, and use animations and UI enhancements to make the user experience better.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

As an agronomy student, I’ve always been passionate about **plants** and **nature**. This project allowed me to bring that passion online by:

- Teaching people about different types of plants  
- Sharing care tips and advice  
- Making plant shopping more accessible and fun  

It's not just a website—it's a prototype of something that could become a **real platform** for connecting people with nature and improving well-being through gardening.
